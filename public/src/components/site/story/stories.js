    "encourages learning and creative thought has pushed me to expand and " +
    "adjust my views and interests. I learned about open source software " +
    "at RIT and, since then, I've created two open source projects which I " +
    "still actively maintain. I'll be graduating next May and I look forward " +
    "to the start of a new journey.",
