    "of experiences, and opportunities for growth. I've been fortunate " +
    "enough to learn from many great professors and expand my skill set in " +
    "the process. I have the opportunity to engage with people from all walks " +
    "of life on a daily basis; everyone knows something you don't, so these " +
    "interactions are priceless. Being in a diverse environment that " +
    "encourages learning and creative thought has pushed me to expand and " +
    "adjust my views and interests. I learned about open source software " +
    "at RIT and, since then, I've created two open source projects which I " +
    "still actively maintain. I'll be graduating next May and I look forward " +
    "to the start of a journey I feel well equipped for.",

      "in their homes, to individuals looking for storage. The app is currently " +
      "under construction but, in the summer of 2018, we conducted a closed beta with " +
      "very encouraging results; more people signed up for the service than our " +
      "projections had suggested. An official beta version of the app will be " +
      "released in December and I'm currently working with a team of developers to " +
      "meet that deadline. The sharing economy has given rise to a variety of " +
      "companies that have disrupted many established industries. Uber, Instacart, " +
      "and Airbnb are just a few examples of companies taking advantage of this trend. " +
      "The storage industry seems ripe for disruption, we might as well be the ones to " +
      "do it.",
