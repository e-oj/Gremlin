    "of experiences, and opportunities for growth. I've been fortunate " +
    "enough to learn from many great professors and expand my skill set in " +
    "the process. I have the opportunity to engage with people from all walks " +
    "of life on a daily basis; everyone knows something you don't, so these " +
    "interactions are priceless. Being in a diverse environment that " +
    "encourages learning and creative thought has pushed me to expand and " +
    "adjust my views and interests. I learned about open source software " +
    "at RIT and, since then, I've created two open source projects which I " +
    "still actively maintain. I'll be graduating next May and I look forward " +
    "to the start of a new journey.",
